## About

I am a fifth-year graduate student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.math.upenn.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Robert Strain](https://strain.math.upenn.edu/) and [Yoichiro Mori](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~y1mori/). <!-- My interests are in fluid dynamics. Before Penn, I was an undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math). My CV is [here](/assets/CV.pdf). -->
